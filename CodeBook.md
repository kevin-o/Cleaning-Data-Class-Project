# This CodeBook.md file describes the structure of the tidy dataset that I submitted for the course project for "Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data" 
## My data was processed from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, vs 1.0

## The original dataset had The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

## Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

## Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

## These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
## '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

## This dataset uses only the mean(): Mean and std(): Standard Deviation of the original measurements

## The tidy dataset is skinny and narrow and has four columns
###  Column 1:  "Subject" and takes the value 1 - 30 representing one of the subjects in either the training or testing datasets
###  Column 2:  "Activity" is a factor variable taking one of six activities as factors:
####    Walking
####    Walking_Upstairs
####    Walking_Downstairs
####    Sitting
####    Standing
####    Laying
#
###  Column 3:  "variable" is one of the 66 measurements that correspond to the measurements that are either "means" (have "mean()" in their names) or "standard deviations" (have "std()" in their names)
